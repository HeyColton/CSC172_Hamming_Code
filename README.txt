  There is only one Hamming class that can correct one error. In the main method, you can choose any test command by deleting its comment notation. You can also copy the main method given by TA YangFeng on his website to test my program.\
   Warning: it\'92s possible for mac or in other cases that you cannot open out.txt after running my program. But you can use terminal to differ out.txt with target documents, then you can see they are the same.}
